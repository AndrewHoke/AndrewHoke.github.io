## Could you fill out a perfect March Madness bracket?

Every year 70 million people fill out their March Madness brackets. For reference, that's like saying if all of France, roughly 70 million people, filled out a bracket on Selection Sunday-that's a lot brackets. Yet, each year every single one of those 70 million people don't fill out a perfect bracket. Someone has to fill out a perfect bracket sometime, right? How safe is Warren Buffet's prize money of one million dollars to anyone who can fill out a perfect bracket, for the rest of their life? Let's explore what is more likely to happen to you than taking home Buffet's one million dollar March Madness challenge.

## Unemployment Rates of Three of the Most Populous States

Unemployment rates are often some of the most debated points in all of politics, and have led to entire campaigns focusing on reducing America's unemployment rate. Efforts such as, expanding monetary and fiscal policy, tax cuts, and domesticating business have all been employed in recent years to lessen unemployment. How effective has our government been in reducing unemployment? If you ask our president its never been better, but let's look at the facts ourselves to see if unemployment truly is decreasing among these three states.
